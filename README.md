This is guess the number . Basically we are creating a random number. Let's suppose their is a random number that is being generated . Say this random number is called ' Target ' . For example if code will generate a random number 35 and user have to guess what is the exactly  target number . So what we will do we will take input from user and if the user will  enter correct target number then the output will be like ' You Successfully completed the game ' . But if the user enters different number for example let's suppose user guess 10 then output will be like your number is less/more then the target. So user should guess a more/less number. Like that . Once the target is correct the game will over.
